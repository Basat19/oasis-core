go/common/identity: Save re-generated sentry client TLS certificate

Sentry client TLS certificate is always re-generated from the private key when
the Oasis Node starts.

Previously, the re-generated sentry client TLS certificate was not saved to
disk, which caused confusion since the on-disk certificate file (i.e.
`sentry_client_tls_identity_cert.pem`) had incorrect/outdated expiry date.
