go/common/identity: Save re-generated node's persistent TLS certificate

If a node's TLS certificate is persistent, it is always re-generated from the
private key when the Oasis Node starts.

Previously, the re-generated node's persistent TLS certificate was not saved
to disk, which caused confusion since the on-disk certificate file (i.e.
`tls_identity_cert.pem`) had incorrect/outdated expiry date.
